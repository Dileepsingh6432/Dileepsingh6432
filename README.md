### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Dileep Singh
 #### About Me
 
As a mechanical engineering graduate, I spent three years working in the ed-tech sector, gaining valuable experience as an academic content developer. It was during this time that I discovered the immense value of data science in driving business growth and innovation. Motivated to pursue this exciting field, I completed a comprehensive data science training program with **Almabetter**. Today, I am passionate about leveraging my skills and knowledge to help businesses stay ahead of the curve through data-driven insights and decision-making.
